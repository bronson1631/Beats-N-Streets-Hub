## Demo flow (local prototype)

To run a quick local prototype without signing up or configuring Supabase:

1. npm install
2. npx expo start
3. Open the app in Expo Go (simulator or device)
4. On the Sign In screen tap "Continue as demo" → Home → "Open Map" to see mock event/artist markers and the audio demo.

This flow uses mock data and does not require external keys. For full features (Supabase auth, Google Maps provider, Stripe payments) supply the API keys and follow the README sections.
